# OTune
A 2 and 3 wheel Robot Odometry Tuning CLI Toolkit for VEX Robotics

## Description
This project uses a ROS system to communicate with a Vive Tracker based external velocity measurement system via SteamVR and the VEX V5 brain for wheel odometer readings via a micro-USB cable. The optimization process implements least squre optimization to tune the parameters required for two and three wheel odometry.
